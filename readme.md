# ðŸ’ŽðŸŒŒ Calakmul

A decentralized network running your favorite apps, databases, and servers.
It uses ruby as language to deploy apps, that are shared through a network of nodes connected using Gossip protocol. 
Each node has its own execution environment and can talk with others, sharing objects in realtime.

Powered by `mruby`, `libp2p` and `rust`

## Run

Open a decentralized repl shell

```shell
cargo run
```

Open a second node connecting to the first

```shell
cargo run "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/49276"
```

## Use

Declare an array on the first node

```shell
a = [1,2,3]
```

On the second node or any node connected to the network you can inspect the object

```shell
a.inspect
```
